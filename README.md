In collaboration with my colleague Stefan Hedesiu we are building a java Application similar to Udemy were clients can buy and attend Courses. All of our Courses have Quizes and Assignments.The clients can rate our courses based on their experience.At first it's going to be a console based aplication with diffrent Types of users like Student and Admin.
Turned in assignements will be graded as a feedback for the students and the clients of the app will be able to send reviews of the courses so that they may be improved. 
One of the main objectives is to lay down the groundwork for all use cases of the program in such a way, that without major changes new areas of learning and development can be added, thus extanding the reach of the application.
